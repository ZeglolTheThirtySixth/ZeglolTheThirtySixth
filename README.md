Hi! I'm Zeglol1234, though I go more commonly online as Hannah.

I'm a ChromeOS/ChromiumOS security researcher, I specifically enjoy just attempting to push Chromebooks to their absolute limits.
Some things I'm good at:
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Bash
- C and C++
- Chromebook exploit/software development

Some projects I've worked on:
- [Tr3nch](https://github.com/Whelement/Tr3nch): Open a menu on any chrome url for running various exploits or custom code
- JumpStart: An advanced RMA Shim/Recovery Image bootloader for ChromeOS and Linux (unfinished)
(I will add plenty more here soon >:3)

My discord is 'zeglol'. I'll try to respond to any dms if you have any questions or wanna chat!
