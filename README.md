Hi, I'm ZeglolTheThirySixth (I'm currently working on migrating  my old profile)

My discord is Zeglol1234
If you wanna message me I don't really mind, I love to chat :D

My skills are:
- Bash
- JavaScript
- C
- Stuff with chromebooks
- Yapping endlessly about random things
- Memorizing and reciting every commercial in existence

I'm currently working on a bunch of cool things, the most notable being:
- Dual booting ChromeOS V81 and V103 off the internal storage using the same userdata for both versions
- A project for reviving a lot of old stuff from ChromeOS and making them actually useful
- A funny vulnerabiliy I found in ChromeOS so that a normal extension can use any private chrome APIs it want :trollface:

Not really sure what else to put here
