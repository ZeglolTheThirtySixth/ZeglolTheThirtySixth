Hi! I'm Zeglol1234, though I go more commonly online as Hannah.

Some things I'm good at:
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Bash
- C and C++
- Chromebook development and security research
- Reverse Engineering
- Pyschology

Some things I'm not good at, but learning:

My discord is 'zeglol'. I'll try to respond to any dms if you have any questions or wanna chat!
I am also of 3 owners of the group [HavenOverflow](https;//github.com/HavenOverflow), you can see a lot of our group's work their!

Do not ask me for hammers! (Thank you!)
