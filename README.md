Hi! I'm Zeglol1234, though I go more commonly online as Hannah.

I'm a ChromeOS/ChromiumOS security researcher, I specifically enjoy just attempting to push Chromebooks to their absolute limits.
Some things I'm good at:
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Bash
- C and C++
- Chromebook exploit/software development

Some projects I have worked on/am currently working on:
- ZegTools: An advanced multi-kernel ChromeOS debugger/bootloader for several purposes (unfinished)
- [Tr3nch 2.0](https://github.com/ZeglolTheThirtySixth/Tr3nch-2.0): Manifest V2/V3 content script context manipulation and XSS (unfinished)
- JumpStart: An advanced RMA Shim/Recovery Image bootloader for ChromeOS and Linux and Android-x86 (unfinished)
- Cr50 Hammer (this is not the actual name): Unenrollment, WP disabling, CCD, etc, all on the latest ChromeOS version (unfinished)

My discord is 'zeglol'. I'll try to respond to any dms if you have any questions or wanna chat!
