Hi! I'm Zeglol1234, though I go more commonly online as Hannah.

I'm an independent ChromiumOS security researcher, though I have worked with other groups
such as [Whelement](https://whelement.me) and [FwSmasher](https://github.com/FwSmasher) in the past on some projects, so check them out too.

Some things I'm good at:
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Bash
- C and C++
- Chromebook exploit/software development

Some projects I made that I'm proud of:
- [Tr3nch](https://github.com/Whelement/Tr3nch): Open a menu on any chrome url for running various exploits or custom code
- [JumpStart](https://github.com/Whelement/JumpStart): An advanced RMA shim/Recovery bootloader for ChromeOS and Linux (unfinished)
- [UnVerifiedBoot](https://github.com/ZeglolTheThirtySixth/UnVerifiedBoot): A ChromeOS firmware modifier to load unverified images without developer mode (unfinished, official ownership given to [kxtz](https://github.com/kxtzownsu))
- [IceBios](https://github.com/ZeglolTheThirtySixth/IceBios): Custom EFI/Legacy firmware payload for RW_LEGACY in EOL Chromebooks (unfinished)

and some private ones that aren't public yet. I do plan on releasing a lot more!

My discord is zeglol1234. I'll try to respond to any dms if you have any questions or wanna chat!
