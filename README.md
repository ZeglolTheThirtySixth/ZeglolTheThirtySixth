Hi, I'm ZeglolTheThirySixth (I'm currently working on migrating  my old profile)
Member of Whelement and FwSmasher :fire:

My discord is Zeglol1234
If you wanna message me I don't really mind, I love to chat :D

My skills are:
- Bash
- JavaScript
- C
- C++ (a little bit)
- Stuff with chromebooks
- Yapping endlessly about random things
- Memorizing and reciting every commercial in existence

I'm currently working on a bunch of cool things, the most notable being:
- Dual booting ChromeOS V81 and V103 off the internal storage using the same userdata for both versions
- Remote Controller V2, A project for reviving a lot of old stuff from ChromeOS and making them actually useful
- Sh0vel, an exploit to run code on almost any url in the chrome browser with full API access :trollface:
- Some private stuff in Whelement and FwSmasher

Not really sure what else to put here
